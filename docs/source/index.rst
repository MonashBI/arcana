Architecture for Repository-Centric ANAlysis (Arcana) is Python package
for "repository-centric" analysis of study groups (e.g. NeuroImaging studies)

Arcana interacts closely with a repository, storing intermediate
outputs, along with the parameters used to derive them, for reuse by
subsequent analyses. Archives can either be XNAT repositories or
(http://xnat.org) local directories organised by subject and visit,
and a BIDS module (http://bids.neuroimaging.io/) is planned as future
work. 

Analysis workflows are constructed and executed using the NiPype
package, and can either be run locally or submitted to high HPC
facilities using NiPypeâ€™s execution plugins. For a requested analysis
output, Arcana determines the required processing steps by querying
the repository to check for missing intermediate outputs before
constructing the workflow graph. When running in an environment
with `the modules package <http://modules.sourceforge.net>`_ installed,
Arcana manages the loading and unloading of software modules per
pipeline node.
