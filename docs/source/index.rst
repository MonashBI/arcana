Mastering the "`arcana <https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/arcana>`_ of scientific
analysis workflows", the obscure knowledge required to apply an appropriate
sequence of community-developed software tools with appropriate
parameterisations in order to analyse a given dataset, can be a time consuming
and challenging process. *Abstraction of Repository-Centric ANAlysis (Arcana)*
provides a framework for researchers to collaboratively implement analyses in a
way that can be reused and extended across wide range of studies and computing
environments. Given a large enough pool of contributors, such code-bases should
mature and become valuable repositories for the arcana of the scientific field.

Central to Arcana's architecture is the implementation of analyses within
subclasses of :class:`arcana.analysis.Analysis`. Arcana interacts closely with a
repository, storing intermediate outputs, along with the parameters used to
derive them, for reuse by subsequent analyses. Repositories can either be XNAT
repositories or (http://xnat.org) local directories organised by subject and
visit, and a BIDS module (http://bids.neuroimaging.io/) is planned as future
work.

Behind the scenes, analysis workflows are constructed and executed using
`NiPype <http://nipype.readthedocs.io>`_, and can either be run locally or
submitted to high HPC facilities using NiPypeâ€™s execution plugins. For a
requested analysis output, Arcana determines the required processing steps by
querying the repository to check for missing intermediate outputs before
constructing the workflow graph. When running in an environment with `the
modules package <http://modules.sourceforge.net>`_ installed, Arcana manages the
loading and unloading of software modules per pipeline node.
